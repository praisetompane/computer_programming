# What is Computer Programming?

![build status](https://github.com/praisetompane/computer_programming/actions/workflows/computer_programming.yaml/badge.svg) <br>

## Objectives
- Attempts to define a unified scientific discipline of computer programming independent of programming language implementations.

## Definitions:
- def computer programming: the act of extending or changing a system's functionality (Haridi and Van Roy, 2004:xv).
  - formal: ???
    - in words: ???
  - intuition: ???
  - properties:
    - learning order:
      - concepts and techniques
      - algorithms and data structures
      - program design and software engineering

    - practitioners:
      - general users: by changing the setting of an alarm
      - expert users: by writing new features for the system or updating existing

  - examples:
    - extending a system's functionality:
      - writing a new application for iOS
    - changing a system's functionality:
      - moving iOS from using 4 digits to 7 digits passwords
  - use cases: ???
      
  - proof: ???

- def computation model(Haridi and Van Roy, 2004:xiii):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: formal system, that defines how computations are done

  - plain english: ???

  - intuition: ???

  - properties:
    - based on a simple core language called its kernel language (Haridi and Van Roy, 2004:xiv)
      - def kernel language: TBD
    - defined in terms of (Haridi and Van Roy, 2004:xiii):
      - data types
      - operations
      - a programming language

      **NB** there are other ways to define computation models: - finite automata (Sipser, 2012:xvii)

    - provides:
      - a programming model:
        - def programming model: a set of programming techniques and design principles
          used to write programs
          in the language of the computation model (Haridi and Van Roy, 2004:29).
          - def programming techniques: TBD
          - def design principles: TBD
      - set of techniques for:
        - reasoning about programs

  - examples: ???

  - use cases: ???
      
  - proof: ???

- def creative extension principle: main criterion for when and which concept to add to a computation mode/kernel language (Haridi and Van Roy, 2004:xiv)

- def technology(Haridi and Van Roy, 2004:xiii): a tool or concept that enables us to do something.

- def λ calculus:

- def π calculus:

- def abstractions:
